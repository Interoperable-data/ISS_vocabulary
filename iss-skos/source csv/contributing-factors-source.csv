CF-1,CF.1,Performance relevant factor,,,ContributingFactors
CF-1-1,CF.1.1,Dynamic situational factors,Temporary or very short-term characteristics of the situation that can influence individuals and the teams or the course of the situation.,CF-1,
CF-1-1-1,CF.1.1.1,Pressure,Refers to two different aspects of the time available (both real or perceived): the pressure generated by uncertainties; changes and the results to be achieved sometimes on competing objectives; and the pressure generated by the time available to analyse; anticipate; coordinate; communicate decide;  act or react; check;  report;  etc.,CF-1-1,
CF-1-1-2,CF.1.1.2,Complexity,Refers to two different aspects of the complexity of the situation. First; it refers to the amount and ambiguity of information and its timing; the interacting activities and actors; and their dynamic evolution from one moment to another; forcing the update or refresh of the memory. Second; it refers to the autonomy left in controlling the situation; in making decisions; in carrying out actions and recovering them; with the eventual delays; before their consequences and their visibility.,CF-1-1,
CF-1-1-3,CF.1.1.3,Monotony,Refers to two different aspects of the monotony within situations. Firstly; the repetition of the situation; and the habit of acting or thinking in a particular way (more mechanical; more automatic). Secondly; boredom due to lack of change in the environment. Both situations induce a challenge to get out of the largely dominant work logic at the right time; and to act differently; considering elements that are maybe rarer or surprising; and somehow temporarily undetected. Because of boredom or repetition; thoughts may deviate from the situation being treated more automatically and may need more time to adapt to change.,CF-1-1,
CF-1-1-4,CF.1.1.4,Work-rhythms,Refers to the hours or periods of work actually worked with two aspects: the distribution of physical and mental workloads during these periods of work (quality and quantity of the work repartition within the time of work); and; the sequence of the actual work periods; with beginning and end time; the effective breaks; organised in 1/2/3 teams over 24 hours and during the last 3 weeks to 3 months (quality of the work shifts or patterns as experienced by the individuals).,CF-1-1,
CF-1-1-5,CF.1.1.5,Environment,Refers to the temporary physical characteristics of the workplace that can have an influence on the physical; mental and emotional state of the worker; including cognitive and social activities in general. It relates to e.g.: visibility and light; noise; vibrations; accessibility; working positions; static and dynamic physical loads; distances to be covered; and variable weather conditions; as they interact with railways activities or decision-making processes.,CF-1-1,

CF-1-2,CF.1.2,Dynamic staff factors,Temporary or very short-term characteristics of individuals and teams that can influence the course of the situation or other concerned staff.,CF-1,
CF-1-2-1,CF.1.2.1,Intentions,Refers to the persons’ intentions which in the situation guide them to decide and act as they do. It covers three aspects: the intention before and during the actions (for which purpose they do what they do); the reasoning in a situation (taking into account how the persons considered the situation at the action time or just before); and when useful; the categorisation of the type of variability or deviation from the intended action (e.g. involuntary – voluntary; positive – negative; type of error; type of violation).,CF-1-2,
CF-1-2-2,CF.1.2.2,Attention,Refers to two aspects that create the conditions for concentration: an external one that regards the different professional activities that influence the capacity for attention because they force this capacity to be divided and therefore reduced; and; an internal one that is more psychological or personal because the flow of thoughts can split the capacity of attention between what or why to do; how to do; when to do and other professional or personal life thoughts.,CF-1-2,
CF-1-2-3,CF.1.2.3,Fatigue,Refers to sleep-related fatigue (in quality; in quantity; at night-time); regardless of the reasons; which is a temporary state that can lead to variations in behaviour or decisions; i.e. deviation; error or violation; e.g. due to missed information; inadequate analysis or unanticipated action. Fatigue is a decreased capacity to perform mental or physical work; with involuntary physiological performance decrements (e.g. hypo-vigilance; micro-sleeps); mood disorders and cognitive impairment; due to inadequate restorative sleep; time of day; length of the waking period; or due to the interaction between the lack of breaks and some characteristics of the activities; etc.,CF-1-2,
CF-1-2-4,CF.1.2.4,Stress,Refers to specific emotions; due to chronic or shocking stimulation and; in its basic meaning; to_any type of change that causes physical; emotional or psychological strain.

CF-1-2-5,CF.1.2.5,Awareness,Refers to both situational awareness and self-awareness. This factor covers the three stages of situational awareness: perception of information; understanding of what is perceived; and projection of how to react on the basis of the perceptions and their understood meaning (including risks).
